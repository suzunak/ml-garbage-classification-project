(This project ran on Windows)

### Usage
1. Clone the project.

2. Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:
```bash
pip install ipykernel kaggle kagglehub matplot opencv-python scikit-learn torchvision
```

3. Modify dataset paths:
- Locate the section with this comment on top:
```bash
#combine all the images with its respective lables
```
- Update:
  - Replace the array of data_set_paths = normalized_dataset_paths
  - Replace combined_dataset_path with your desired folder location to store the combined images.

4. Everything should be good to run.
